Directory of people in a building.

## Motive

Liszt aims to provide an easy-to-use and secure interface for visitors to identify and communicate with residents.

### Design

#### Querying for residents

Typically, buildings assign identifiers to their units. This is one way visitors can query for a resident they wish to reach. Residents should attach their identities to these unit identifiers in order for visitors to query for them by name.

#### Communication

A simple phone call from a known number to a resident's registered phone number will cover the majority of use cases. However, it will be useful to be able to reach residents by other means, such as SMS or other third party messaging applications. Liszt supports many of these communication methods in order to make it as easy as possible for residents. Building managers will not have to do anything for this to work, as it is entirely self-service.
